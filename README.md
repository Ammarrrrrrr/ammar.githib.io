# Ammar — Portfolio

This is a lightweight, static portfolio website ready for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new repository named `ammarrrrrrr.github.io` (or use your existing one).
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repository root.
3. Commit and push. Pages will serve from `https://ammarrrrrrr.github.io`.
4. Optional: Set a custom domain in **Settings → Pages** (e.g., `ammar.qzz.io`) and add DNS records as required.
5. Edit your email, LinkedIn, and resume file (replace `resume.pdf`).

## Customize

- **Config:** In `index.html`, update `window.PORTFOLIO_CONFIG.githubUser` if needed.
- **About/Skills/Sections:** Edit the HTML content in the respective sections.
- **Theme:** The site supports light/dark with a toggle and follows system preference.
- **Projects:** Repos are loaded from the GitHub API at runtime and can be searched/sorted.

Enjoy!
